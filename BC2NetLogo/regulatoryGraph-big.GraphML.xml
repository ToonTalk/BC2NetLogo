VARIABLE: PDK1 activation level

PDK1 is a PI3K target, leading to activation of p70 and subsequent cell growth.
Signaling proteins with pleckstrin-homology (PH) domains accumulate at sites of PI3K activation by directly binding to PI(3,4,5)P3. Of particular interest are the protein serine-threonine kinases Akt and phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1). Association with PI(3,4,5)P3 at the membrane brings these proteins into proximity and facilitates phosphorylation of Akt by PDK1. This phosphorylation stimulates the catalytic activity of Akt, resulting in the phosphorylation of a host of other proteins that affect cell growth, cell cycle entry, and cell survival.

VARIABLE: FRS2 phosphorylation level

FGF stimulation leads to phosphorylation of Shp2 on a tyrosine residue that forms a complex with an additional molecule of Grb2. Grb2/Sos complexes are thus recruited directly and indirectly via Shp2 upon tyrosine phosphorylation of FRS2a in response to growth factor stimulation.
PMID:11447289

Spry is induced by activated ERK. It positively regulates EGFR signalling by sequestering Cbl (positive feedback in the model, from Spry to EGFR), whereas it negatively regulates FGFR signalling by sequestering Grb2 from FSR2 (negative feedback in the model, from Spry to FSR2).
PMID:15173823

FGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of FRS2 results in complex formation with the adaptor protein Grb2 bound to Cbl by means of its SH3 domains. FGF-induced ternary complex formation among FRS2, Grb2, and Cbl results in ubiquitination and degradation of FRS2 and FGF receptor (FGFR).

VARIABLE: PI3K activation level

Grb2 recruits the docking protein Gab1, which is tyrosine phosphorylated by FGFR, leading to
recruitment and activation of the PI3K-Akt cell survival pathway.
EGF stimulates a cell survival pathway mediated by phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and the protein kinase Akt by an indirect mechanism in which tyrosine phosphorylation of the docking protein Gab1 or ErbB3 by EGFR leads to recruitment and activation of PI3K.
PMID:15567848

Recruitment and activation of PI 3-kinase by Gab1 results in a positive-feedback loop mediated by binding of the PH domain of Gab1 to the product of PI3-kinase activation, phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate.
Phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3), the reaction product of PI 3-kinase, is responsible for activation of phosphoinositide-dependent kinase (PDK) and the antiapoptotic protein kinase Akt.

MSK1 and MSK2 are potently activated (by phosphorylation) in vivo by ERK1/2 and p38 but not JNK.
MSK1 mediates the mitogen-stimulated phoshphorylation of CREB.
PMID:15187187

Translocation of ERK into the nucleus activates the mitogen activated and stress-activated protein kinase 1 (MSK1), a histone H3 kinase that can relax chromatin, thus making it more transcriptionally accessible. This alteration in the chromatin state induces MYC, a gene that encodes the c-Myc protein, a transcription factor that controls the cell cycle.

         <data key="KIND">Gene</data>MDM2 = Mdm2, p53 E3 ubiquitin protein ligase homolog (mouse)

VARIABLE: MDM2 gene expression level

The Mdm2 protein is involved in an autoregulatory feedback loop with p53, thus controlling its activity. Increased p53 levels transactivate the MDM2 promoter causing its upregulation. The translated protein then binds to p53 and transports it to the proteasome for ubiquitin-mediated degradation. The resultant lowered p53 levels then reduce the levels of Mdm2. The MDM2 gene is, in turn, transcriptionally inhibited by p14, providing another fine level of control for p53 activity.
PMID:17158541

Effective recruitment of Akt by appropriate survival signals may lead to activation of Mdm2, inactivation of p53, and eventually inhibition of p53-dependent apoptosis.

TAO kinases are MAP3Ks that function upstream of p38 and JNK.
PMID:21614932

DUSP1 preferentially inactivates JNK and p38.
PMID:19436832

JNK phosphorylates MST1 at serine 82, which leads to the enhancement of MST1 activation. The activation of MST1 phosphorylates FOXO3 at serine 207 and promotes cell death.
PMID:20028971

JNK and p38 can both phosphorylate ATF2 at Thr69 and Ser71.
JNK can phosphorylate the c-Juntrans-activating domain at Ser63 and Ser73. JNKs, but not the ERKs or p38s, binds c-Jun quite strongly.
ELK1 is a nuclear JNK target.
MEKK1 can interact with Ras in a GTP-dependent manner. The GTP-dependent coupling of MEKK1 to Ras indicates that MEKK1 may be an effector for those agonists that recruit JNK through Ras-dependent mechanisms.

VARIABLE: AP-1 formation

AP-1 is a heterodimer comprised of bZIP transcription factors, typically c-Jun and JunD, along with members of the fos (usually c-Fos) and ATF (usually ATF2) families. All bZIP transcription factors contain leucine zippers that enable homo- and heterodimerisation, and AP-1 components are organised into Jun-Jun, Jun-Fos, or Jun-ATF dimers.

PMID:17496910

The signaling pathways activated by FGFRs substantially overlap with those activated by EGFRs.
Grb2 molecules bound to FRS2 recruit the nucleotide exchange factor SOS, leading to the activation of the Ras-MAPK signaling cascade.

VARIABLE: p38 (any isoform) phosphorylation level

p38 and JNK are activated after expression of GADD45, following stress, through MTK1.
Expression of GADD45 genes in mammalian cells strongly activates co-expressed MTK1, as well as p38 and JNK, the MAPKs downstream of MTK1.
TAO kinases are MAP3Ks that function upstream of p38 and JNK.
Activated p38 phosphorylates p53 at several residues, including Ser33, and thereby increases the transcriptional activity of p53. Activated p53 then induces apoptosis in cells that have suffered extensive DNA damage. When the intensity of the damage is moderate, however, the cell can repair the damage and escape apoptotic cell death by down-regulating p38-p53 signaling. Under these conditions, p53-induced Wip1 phosphatase interacts with activated p38 and selectively dephosphorylates p38 at the phospho-Thr180 residue, thereby reducing its kinase activity towards p53.

PMID:2472219

Recruitment to the membrane and tyrosine phosphorylation enhance the enzymatic activity of PLC-g, leading to the formation of two second messengers, diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3). IP3 releases Ca2+ from internal stores, which in turn acts in concert with DAG to translocate protein kinase C (PKC) to the cell membrane and stimulate its enzymatic activity.
PMID:15567848

RasGRP1 is a C1-domain containing protein that is activated by DAG and Ca2+, in a manner analogous to members of the PKC family.
PMID:17496910

Calcium liberated from internal stores by IP3 acts on the calcium- and DAG-sensitive RasGRP1 and causes it to translocate to the Golgi. RasGRP1 activates Golgi-associated Ras on this compartment.

VARIABLE: AKT (any isoform) phosphorylation level

Grb2 recruits the docking protein Gab1, which is tyrosine phosphorylated by FGFR, leading to
recruitment and activation of the PI3K-Akt cell survival pathway.
EGF stimulates a cell survival pathway mediated by phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and the protein kinase Akt by an indirect mechanism in which tyrosine phosphorylation of the docking protein Gab1 or ErbB3 by EGFR leads to recruitment and activation of PI3K.
PMID:15567848

Signaling proteins with pleckstrin-homology (PH) domains accumulate at sites of PI3K activation by directly binding to PI(3,4,5)P3. Of particular interest are the protein serine-threonine kinases Akt and phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1). Association with PI(3,4,5)P3 at the membrane brings these proteins into proximity and facilitates phosphorylation of Akt by PDK1. This phosphorylation stimulates the catalytic activity of Akt, resulting in the phosphorylation of a host of other proteins that affect cell growth, cell cycle entry, and cell survival.
Akt phosphorylation of the apoptosis-inducing protein Bad creates a binding site for 14-3-3 proteins and prevents Bad from binding to Bcl-2 family members Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, thus releasing them for a cell survival response.
Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) is a target of Akt. This protein kinase is constitutively active in unstimulated cells and phosphorylates many proteins (including glycogen synthase, c-Myc, and cyclin D) to keep them in inactive states or promote their degradation. Phosphorylation of GSK3 (both alpha and beta isoforms) by Akt turns off the catalytic activity of this enzyme, resulting in the activation of pathways that are normally repressed by GSK3.
Phosphorylation of FOXO3 by Akt creates a binding site for the 14-3-3 family of proteins. The complex of FOXO3 and 14-3-3 is retained in the cytosol, blocking transcription of genes normally stimulated by FOXO3.
PMID:12040186

p21 is a direct substrate of AKT and that this may regulate the subcellular localisation of p21. Phosphorylation of p21 by AKT correlated with its exit from the nucleus and with increased cell cycle progression.
PMID:11882383

Phosphorylation by Akt inhibits EGF-dependent activity of B-Raf and C-Raf.

Effective recruitment of Akt by appropriate survival signals may lead to activation of Mdm2, inactivation of p53, and eventually inhibition of p53-dependent apoptosis.

VARIABLE: MYC activation level (implies gene expression)

Modelling hypotheses: MSK determines MYC gene expression, so it is always needed for MYC activation; MAX activates MYC protein; AKT inhibits GSK3B, which in turn inactivates MYC protein

Translocation of ERK into the nucleus activates the mitogen activated and stress-activated protein kinase 1 (MSK1), a histone H3 kinase that can relax chromatin, thus making it more transcriptionally accessible. This alteration in the chromatin state induces MYC, a gene that encodes the c-Myc protein, a transcription factor that controls the cell cycle. c-Myc signals downstream to promote expression of cyclins that complex with CDKs.
MYC inhibits p16, whereas it activates p14.
PMID:17158541

MAX interacts with the transcription factor c-Myc (this interaction is modelled here by complex formation) enabling c-Myc to trans-activate at least a subset of its target genes.
PMID:11274345

Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) is a target of Akt. This protein kinase is constitutively active in unstimulated cells and phosphorylates many proteins (including glycogen synthase, c-Myc, and cyclin D) to keep them in inactive states or promote their degradation. Phosphorylation of GSK3 (both alpha and beta isoforms) by Akt turns off the catalytic activity of this enzyme, resulting in the activation of pathways that are normally repressed by GSK3.

Grb2, bound to Cbl, does not interact directly with FGFR but, rather, binds to tyrosine-phosphorylated FRS2, promoting ubiquitination and degradation of FRS2 and FGFR
PMID:15567848

FGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of FRS2 results in complex formation with the adaptor protein Grb2 bound to Cbl by means of its SH3 domains. FGF-induced ternary complex formation among FRS2, Grb2, and Cbl results in ubiquitination and degradation of FRS2 and FGF receptor (FGFR).

TGF-beta-induced ShcA phosphorylation induces ShcA association with Grb2 and Sos, thereby initiating the well-characterised pathway linking receptor tyrosine kinases with Erk MAP kinases.

Grb2 molecules recruit the nucleotide exchange factor SOS, leading to the activation of the Ras-MAPK signaling cascade.
Most of the signals activating the ERK pathway are initiated through receptor-mediated activation of the small G-protein, Ras. Ras is a membrane-bound protein activated through the exchange of bound GDP to GTP. The process of activating Ras thereby requires the recruitment of proteins responsible for initiating GDP/GTP exchange to the membrane, such as SOS (son of sevenless).
Activated Ras recruits cytoplasmic Raf (MAPKKK) for activation (through phosphorylation). There are three mammalian serine/threonine Raf kinases: A-Raf, B-Raf, and Raf-1 (also known as C-Raf). All three Raf proteins share the same downstream MAPKK substrate mitogen activated protein kinase kinases 1,2 (MEK1,2).
PMID:18039929

The GTP-dependent coupling of MEKK1 to Ras indicates that MEKK1 may be an effector for those agonists that recruit JNK through Ras-dependent mechanisms. MEKK1 selectively activates the endogenous JNK pathway. MEKK1 can activate MEK4 and MEK7 in vivo.
